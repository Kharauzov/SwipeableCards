## Overview
The idea of the project is to show implemented concept of how content could be provided to the user and in what way the user could interact with it considering modern trends.

- Possibilities of `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` and `UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning` protocols for creating custom interactive transitions at iOS.
- Injection of `UIGestureRecognizer` object can expand possibilities of UICollectionView’s cells and distinguish it from the rest of the screen’s components.
